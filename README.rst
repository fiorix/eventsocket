About
=====
`eventsocket` is a Twisted protocol for the FreeSWITCH's Event Socket. This protocol provides support for both Inbound and Outbound methods of the Event Socket in a single-file class.

It may be used for a wide variety of purposes. It aims to be simple and extensible, and to export all the functionality of the FreeSWITCH to Twisted-based applications.

Moreover, it's totally event-driven and allows easy implementation of complex applications aiming at controlling the FreeSWITCH through the Event Socket.

This code is part of the core of the `Nuswit Telephony API <http://nuswit.com>`_, a full featured web-based dialer currently operating in Brazil and Colombia.
